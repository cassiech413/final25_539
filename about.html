                    Hi! I'm Cassie — a graduate student at the University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI),
                    focusing on user experience design and human-computer interaction.
                    I started listening to Vocaloid and J-pop when I was in middle school, and it quickly became one
                    of the most important influences in my creative life. These songs accompanied me through growing up,
                    inspired my aesthetics, and shaped how I express emotion, storytelling, and identity.
                    This playlist and project are a small tribute to the music that raised me and inspire the way I design and imagine my world.
